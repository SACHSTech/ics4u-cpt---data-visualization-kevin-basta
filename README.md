###  Description of Data set
* This dataset has information about 247 of the largest companies in Japan.
* The original values that are given are global rank, company name, sales, profits, assets, and market value.
* I added the type of company and company description to enhance my data set and allow for better visualization and sorting.

### Why I selected this data set for this project
* I aspire to one day open my own copany and in general, I really like exploring different companies that I don't know about. Each part of the world has a drastically different economic structure and I think that seeing different trends and things like what type of companies are dominating the country, which companies make the most money, and which contribute the most to the country's economy is very intresting.
* Japan is an intriguing place because it only opened it's borders to forign trade in 1853. This means that it's economy would be drastically different than the rest of the world's economies because it survived without forign trade for so long.
* Overall I pick the Japanese largest companies data set becasue I wanted to learn about the types of companies that are in Japan, see the trends in companies of a country that was closed off to the world for so long, and just to enjoy the project working with a data set that I liked.
